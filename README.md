# Project Synopsis

For this project, I created an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. The objective was to make a pirate who could navigate a maze and determine the best route to a hidden treasure. The task at hand involved utilizing deep Q-learning techniques to facilitate the pirate's learning and successful navigation across a matrix representation of the maze.

The TreasureMaze.py file, which is a representation of the labyrinth object, defines the game environment. A repository for the agent's experiences, the GameExperience.py file has episodes that comprise every state encountered between the beginning and terminal states. The pirate's ability to investigate and refine its decision-making is made possible by this stored experience, which is essential to its learning process.

# My contribution 
Was to finish the deep Q-learning algorithm's implementation. I had to fill in the specifics after being given a basic foundation. This involved constructing the learning loop in which the agent interacts with the environment, building up the deep learning model using Keras, and specifying the learning parameters including the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate. In order to improve its capacity to navigate the maze, the agent gathers experiences and refreshes its knowledge through this procedure.

# Moral Aspects to Take into Account

Despite concentrating on a straightforward game, this research raises more general ethical concerns pertinent to artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, such as the deep Q-learning I utilized here, is used in a variety of real-world applications, from financial modeling to autonomous systems.

The possibility of bias and fairness in the agent's actions is one important ethical aspect. The training data and reward function design impact the model's judgments, hence it is crucial to guarantee both components are impartial and encourage equity. Transparency is another important issue; as AI systems get more complicated, it gets harder to comprehend how and why a particular agent makes a choice. This experiment made me realize how crucial explainability is in artificial intelligence, where it is essential that users understand the reasoning behind an agent's behaviors.

Another crucial factor is safety, particularly when AI agents are working in settings where people or vital systems are involved. The ideas of safety in AI design apply to more complicated circumstances where an agent's actions might have substantial effects, even if the pirate's conduct in this game is simple.

# Relationship to Computer Science

My project's work serves as a microcosm of larger developments in computer science, especially in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As the pirate agent in this game demonstrates, reinforcement learning is a potent technique that is applied in many different contexts where independent decision-making is necessary. The ideas I investigated for this project serve as the basis for more sophisticated systems that are employed in both research and industry.

My contributions to the deep Q-learning algorithm's completion extend beyond the narrow labyrinth navigation problem. They provide as examples of the kind of critical thinking and problem-solving that are essential to a computer scientist's work. The abilities I gained from this project are immediately transferable to the larger area, whether I'm creating software, building algorithms, or conducting new research.
